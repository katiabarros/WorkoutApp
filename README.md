This project is originally a video/project from the Youtube channel Tech With Tim. (https://www.youtube.com/@TechWithTim) The original project is here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msLovKSj8Q0. The difference is that in the original one, he uses LLMs and Vector Stores from OpenAI while here I'm using only open source models and running all locally. 

## Required Ollama Models
Before running the project, install the necessary models:

```bash
ollama pull nomic-embed-text:latest
ollama pull qwen2.5:3b
